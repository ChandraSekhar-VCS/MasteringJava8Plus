ask 2: Use Lambdas with Built-In Functional Interfaces

Objective: Work with Predicate, Function, and Consumer interfaces.

Instructions:
Create a list of strings with different names.
Perform the following:
Use a Predicate lambda to filter names that start with a specific letter (e.g., 'A').
Use a Function lambda to transform the filtered names to uppercase.
Use a Consumer lambda to print the names.
Use chained operations or loop+lambda combinations based on what you feel most comfortable with.
