Task 1: Create and Use a Custom Functional Interface

Objective: Design a custom functional interface to perform different operations using lambdas.

Instructions:
Define a custom functional interface that takes two integers and returns an integer result.
Implement 3 lambda expressions using this interface:
One for addition
One for subtraction
One for multiplication
Create a method that accepts two integers and a lambda (using the custom interface) and returns the result.
Use this method to test all three operations.
